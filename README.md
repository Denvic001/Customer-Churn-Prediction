# Customer-Churn-Prediction
### Project Overview

Customer churn—the phenomenon where customers discontinue their subscription to a service—poses a significant challenge for subscription-based businesses. Accurately predicting which customers are likely to leave enables companies to proactively engage at-risk customers, optimize retention strategies, and ultimately improve profitability. This project aims to develop a predictive model using machine learning techniques such as logistic regression and random forests, combined with thoughtful feature engineering, to identify customers at high risk of churn. The insights derived will inform actionable business recommendations and a cost-benefit analysis to guide retention efforts
### Business Understanding
For subscription-based businesses, retaining existing customers is often more cost-effective than acquiring new ones. High churn rates can signal underlying issues with customer satisfaction, product fit, or competitive pressures, directly impacting revenue and growth. By understanding the drivers of churn and identifying at-risk customers, the business can:
Target retention campaigns more effectively (e.g., personalized offers, improved customer support)
Allocate resources efficiently to maximize return on investment in retention
Reduce lost revenue and improve customer lifetime value
The key business questions addressed in this project are:
Which customers are most likely to leave the service in the near future?
What are the main factors contributing to customer churn?
How can the business intervene to reduce churn, and what is the expected financial impact of these interventions?
The project will use historical customer data—including demographics, service usage, account information, and previous churn behavior—to build and evaluate predictive models. The final deliverables will include actionable recommendations and a cost-benefit analysis to support data-driven decision-making for customer retention.
